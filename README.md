# predicting_gas_prices

usage without any warranty

Both python files are identical, just one is used on a raspberry pi. 

The prediction of gasoline prices is based on historical data (taken from https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/). Then several ML-algorithms were tested, finally a ExtraTreesRegressor was used (sklearn). Also other data is used (such as holidays, weather data). 

a visualization is available under https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/markus.g.hler7472/viz/Gasprice_16236148421350/Spritpreis

A statistical analysis of the gasoline prices will also be uploaded soon.
